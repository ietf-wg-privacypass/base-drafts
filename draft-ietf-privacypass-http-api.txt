1.  Introduction

   The Privacy Pass protocol as described in
   [draft-davidson-pp-protocol] can be integrated with a number of
   different settings, from server to server communication to browsing
   the internet.

   In this document, we will provide an API to use for integrating
   Privacy Pass with an HTTP framework.  Providing the format of HTTP
   requests and responses needed to implement the Privacy Pass protocol.

1.1.  Terminology

   We use the same definition of server and client that is used in
   [draft-davidson-pp-protocol] and [draft-davidson-pp-architecture].

   We assume that all protocol messages are encoded into raw byte format
   before being sent.  We use the TLS presentation language [RFC8446] to
   describe the structure of protocol messages.

1.2.  Layout

   *  Section 2: Describes the wrapping of messages within HTTP
      requests/responses.

   *  Section 3: Describes how HTTP clients retrieve server
      configurations and key commitments.

   *  Section 5: Describes how issuance requests are performed via a
      HTTP API.

   *  Section 6: Describes how redemption requests are performed via a
      HTTP API.

1.3.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Privacy Pass HTTP API Wrapping

   Messages from HTTP-based clients to HTTP-based servers are performed
   as GET and POST requests.  The messages are sent via the "Sec-
   Privacy-Pass" header.

   "Sec-Privacy-Pass" is a Dictionary Structured Header
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-15].  The dictionary has two
   keys:

   *  "type" whose value is a String conveying the function that is
      being performed with this request.

   *  "body" whose value is a byte sequence containing a Privacy Pass
      protocol message.

   Note that the requests may contain addition Headers, request data and
   URL parameters that are not specified here, these extra fields should
   be ignored, though may be used by the server to determine whether to
   fulfill the requested issuance/redemption.

3.  Server key registry

   A client SHOULD fetch a server's current public key information prior
   to performing issuance and redemption.  This configuration is
   accessible via a "CONFIG_ENDPOINT", either provided by the server or
   by a global registry that provides consistency and anonymization
   guarantees.

3.1.  Key Registry

   To ensure that a server isn't providing different views of their
   public key material to different users, servers are expected to write
   their commitments to a verifiable data structure.

   Using a verifiable log-backed map ([verifiable-data-structures]), the
   server can publish their commitments to the log in a way that clients
   can detect when the server is attempting to provide a split-view of
   their key commitments to different clients.

   The key to the map is the "server_origin", with the value being:

   struct {
       opaque public_key<1..2^16-1>;
       uint64 expiry;
       uint8 supported_methods; # 3:Issue/Redeem, 2:Redeem, 1:Issue
       opaque signature<1..2^16-1>;
   } KeyCommitment;

   struct {
       opaque server_id<1..2^16-1>;
       uint16 ciphersuite;
       opaque verification_key<1..2^16-1>;
       KeyCommitment commitments<1..2^16-1>;
   }

   The addition to the log is made via a signed message to the log
   operator, which verifies the authenticity against a public key
   associated with that server origin (either via the Web PKI or a out-
   of-band key).  The signature should be computed under a long-term
   signing key that is associated with the server identity.

   The server SHOULD then store an inclusion proof of the current key
   commitment so that it can present it when delivering the key
   commitment directly to the client or when the key commitment is being
   delivered by a delegated party (other registries/preloaded
   configuration lists/etc).

   The client can then perform a request for the key commitment against
   either the global registry or the server as described in Section 4.
   Note that the signature should be verified by the client to ensure
   that the key material is owned by the server.  This requires that the
   client know the public verification key that is associated with the
   server.

   To avoid user segregation as a result of server configuration/
   commitment rotation, the log operator SHOULD enforce limits on how
   many active commitments exist and how quickly the commitments are
   being rotated.  Clients SHOULD reject configurations/commitments that
   violate their requirements for avoiding user segregation.  These
   considerations are discussed as part of
   [draft-davidson-pp-architecture].

3.2.  Server Configuration Retrieval

   Inputs: - "server_origin": The origin to retrieve a server
   configuration for.

   No outputs.

   1.  The client makes an anonymous GET request to
       "CONFIG_ENDPOINT"/.well-known/privacy-pass with a message of type
       "fetch-config" and a body of:

   struct {
       opaque server_origin<1..2^16-1>;
   }

   1.  The server looks up the configuration associated with the origin
       "server_origin" and responds with a message of type "config" and
       a body of:

   struct {
       opaque server_id<1..2^16-1>;
       uint16 ciphersuite;
       opaque commitment_id<1..2^8-1>;
       opaque verification_key<1..2^16-1>;
   }

   1.  The client then stores the associated configuration state under
       the corresponding "server_origin".

   (TODO: This might be mergable with key commitment retrieval if
   server_id = server_origin)

4.  Key Commitment Retrieval

   The client SHOULD retrieve server key commitments prior to both an
   issuance and redemption to verify the consistency of the keys and to
   monitor for key rotation between issuance and redemption events.

   Inputs: - "server_origin": The origin to retrieve a key commitment
   for.

   No outputs.

   1.  The client fetches the configuration state "server_id",
       "ciphersuite", "commitment_id" associated with "server_origin".

   2.  The client makes an anonymous GET request to
       "CONFIG_ENDPOINT"/.well-known/privacy-pass with a message of type
       "fetch-commitment" and a body of:

   struct {
       opaque server_id<1..2^16-1> = server_id;
       opaque commitment_id<1..2^8-1> = commitment_id;
   }

   1.  The server looks up the current configuration, and constructs a
       list of commitments to return, noting whether a key commitment is
       valid for issuance or redemption or both.

   2.  The server then responds with a message of type "commitment" and
       a body of:

   struct {
       opaque public_key<1..2^16-1>;
       uint64 expiry;
       uint8 supported_methods; # 3:Issue/Redeem, 2:Redeem, 1:Issue
       opaque signature<1..2^16-1>;
   } KeyCommitment;

   struct {
       opaque server_id<1..2^16-1>;
       uint16 ciphersuite;
       opaque verification_key<1..2^16-1>;
       KeyCommitment commitments<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque inclusion_proofs<1..2^16-1>;
   }

   1.  The client then verifies the signature for each key commitment
       and stores the list of commitments to the current scope.  The
       client SHOULD NOT cache the commitments beyond the current scope,
       as new commitments should be fetched for each independent
       issuance and redemption request.  The client SHOULD verify the
       "inclusion_proofs" to confirm that the key commitment has been
       submitted to a trusted registry.  Once the client receives the
       "ciphersuite" for the server, it should implement all Privacy
       Pass API functions (as detailed in [draft-davidson-pp-protocol])
       using this ciphersuite.

5.  Privacy Pass Issuance

   Inputs: - "server_origin": The origin to request token issuance from.
   - "count": The number of tokens to request issuance for.

   Outputs: - "tokens": A list of tokens that have been signed via the
   Privacy Pass protocol.

   1.  When a client wants to request tokens from a server, it should
       first fetch a key commitment from the server via the process
       described in Section 4 and keep the result as "commitment".

   2.  The client should then call the "Generate" function requesting
       "count" tokens storing the resulting "input" data.

   3.  The client then makes a POST request to <"server_origin">/.well-
       known/privacy-pass with a message of type "request-issuance" and
       a body of:

   enum { Normal(0) } IssuanceType;

   struct {
       IssuanceType type = 0;
       opaque msg<0..2^16-1> = input.msg;
   }

   1.  The server, upon receipt of the "request" should call the "Issue"
       function with the "public_key", "secret_key" and the value of
       "msg" with a result of "resp".

   2.  The server should then respond to the POST request with a message
       of type "issue" and a body of:

   struct {
       IssuanceType type = request.type;
       IssuanceResp resp = resp;
   }

   1.  The client should then should call the "Process" function with
       the "public_key", stored "inputs" and resulting "resp", to
       extract a list of "redemption_tokens".

   2.  The client should store the "public_key" associated with these
       tokens and the elements of "redemption_tokens" under storage
       partitioned by the "server_origin", accessible only via the
       Privacy Pass API.

6.  Privacy Pass Redemption

   There are two forms of Privacy Pass redemption that could function
   under the HTTP API.  Either passing along a token directly to the
   target endpoint, which would perform its own redemption Section 6.1,
   or the client redeeming the token and passing the result along to the
   target endpoint.  These two methods are described below.

6.1.  Generic Token Redemption

   Inputs: - "server_id": The server ID to redeem a token against. -
   "ciphersuite": The ciphersuite for this token. - "public_key": The
   public key associated with this token. - "redemption_token": A
   Privacy Pass token. - "info": Additional data to bind to this token
   redemption.

   Outputs: - "result": The result of the redemption from the server.

   1.  The client should call the "Redeem" function with
       "redemption_token" and additional data of "info" storing the
       resulting "data" and "tag".

   2.  The client makes a POST request to <"server_origin">/.well-known/
       privacy-pass with a message of type "token-redemption" and a body
       of:

   struct {
       opaque server_id<1..2^16-1> = server_id;
       opaque data<1..2^16-1> = data;
       opaque tag<1..2^16-1> = tag;
       opaque info<1..2^16-1> = info;
   }

   1.  The server, upon receipt of "request" should call the "Verify"
       interface with "public_key", "secret_key" and the received
       "data", "tag", "info" storing the resulting "resp".

   2.  The server should then respond to the POST request with a message
       of type "redemption-result" and a signed body of:

   struct {
       opaque info<1..2^16-1> = info;
       uint8 result = resp;
       // signature of info and result using
       // the server's verification key.
       opaque signature<1..2^16-1>;
   }

   1.  The client upon receipt of this message should verify the
       "signature" using the "verification_key" from the configuration
       and return the "result".

6.2.  Direct Redemption

   Inputs: - "server_origin": The server origin to redeem a token for. -
   "target": The target endpoint to send the token to. -
   "additional_data": Additional data to bind to this redemption
   request.

   1.  When a client wants to redeem tokens for a server, it should
       first fetch a key commitment from the server via the process
       described in Section 4 and keep the result as "commitment".

   2.  The client should then look up the storage partition associated
       with "server_origin" and fetch a "redemption_token" and
       "public_key".

   3.  The client should verify that the "public_key" is in the current
       "commitment".  If not, it should discard the token and fail the
       redemption attempt.

   4.  As part of the request to "target", the client will include the
       token as part of the request in the "Sec-Privacy-Pass" header
       along with whatever other parameters are being passed as part of
       the request to "target".  The header will contain a message of
       type "token-redemption" with a body of:

   struct {
       opaque server_id<1..2^16-1> = server_id;
       uint16 ciphersuite = ciphersuite;
       opaque public_key<1..2^16-1> = public_key;
       RedemptionToken token<1..2^16-1> = redemption_token;
       opaque additional_data<1..2^16-1> = additional_data;
   }

   At this point, the "target" can perform a generic redemption as
   described in Section 6.1 by forwarding the message included in the
   request to "target".

6.3.  Delegated Redemption

   Inputs: - "server_origin": The server origin to redeem a token for. -
   "target": The target endpoint to send the token to. -
   "additional_data": Additional data to bind to this redemption
   request.

   1.  When a client wants to redeem tokens for a server, it should
       first fetch a key commitment from the server via the process
       described in Section 4 and keep the result as "commitment".

   2.  The client should then look up the storage partition associated
       with "server_origin" and fetch a "redemption_token" and
       "public_key".

   3.  The client should verify that the "public_key" is in the current
       "commitment".  If not, it should discard the token and fail the
       redemption attempt.

   4.  The client constructs a bytestring "info" made up of the
       "target", the current "timestamp", and "additional_data":

   struct {
       opaque target<1..2^16-1>;
       uint64 timestamp;
       opaque additional_data<0..2^16-1>;
   }

   1.  The client then performs a token redemption as described in
       Section 6.1.  Storing the resulting "redemption-result" message.

   2.  As part of the request to "target", the client will include the
       redemption result as part of the request in the "Sec-Privacy-
       Pass" header along with whatever other parameters are being
       passed as part of the request to "target".  The header will
       contain a message of type "signed-redemption-result" with a body
       of:

   struct {
       opaque server_origin<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque target<1..2^16-1>;
       uint64 timestamp;
       opaque additional_data<1..2^16-1> = additional_data;
       opaque signed_redemption<1..2^16-1>;
   }

   At this point, the "target" can verify the integrity of
   "signed_redemption.info" based on the values of "target",
   "timestamp", and "additional_data" and verify the signature of the
   redemption result by querying the current configuration of the
   Privacy Pass server.  The inclusion of "target" and "timestamp"
   proves that the server attested to the validity of the token in
   relation to this particular request.
