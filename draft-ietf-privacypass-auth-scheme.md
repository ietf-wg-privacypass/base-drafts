--- abstract

This document defines an HTTP authentication scheme for Privacy Pass,
a privacy-preserving authentication mechanism used for authorization.
The authentication scheme in this document can be used by clients
to redeem Privacy Pass tokens with an origin. It can also be used by
origins to challenge clients to present Privacy Pass tokens.

--- middle

# Introduction {#introduction}

Privacy Pass tokens are unlinkable, one-time-use authenticators that can be used to
anonymously authorize a client (see
{{?ARCHITECTURE=I-D.ietf-privacypass-architecture}}).
Tokens are generated by token issuers, on the basis of authentication,
attestation, or some previous action such as solving a CAPTCHA. A client
possessing such a token is able to prove that it was able to get a token
issued, without allowing the relying party redeeming the client's token
(the origin) to link it with the issuance flow.

Different types of authenticators, using different token issuance protocols,
can be used as Privacy Pass tokens.

This document defines a common HTTP authentication scheme
({{!RFC9110, Section 11}}), PrivateToken, that allows clients to redeem various
kinds of Privacy Pass tokens.

Clients and relying parties (origins) interact using this scheme to perform the
token challenge and token redemption flow. In particular, origins challenge
clients for a token with an HTTP Authentication challenge (using the
WWW-Authenticate response header field). Clients then respond to that challenge
with an HTTP authentication response (using the Authorization request header
field). Clients produce an authentication response based on the origin's token
challenge by running the token issuance protocol
{{?ISSUANCE=I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol}}. The act of presenting a token in an
Authorization request header is referred to as token redemption. This
interaction between client and origin is shown below.

{: #fig-overview title="Challenge-response redemption protocol flow"}

In addition to working with different token issuance protocols, this scheme
optionally supports use of tokens that are associated with origin-chosen
contexts and specific origin names. Relying parties that request and redeem
tokens can choose a specific kind of token, as appropriate for its use case.
These options allow for different deployment models to prevent double-spending,
and allow for both interactive (online challenges) and non-interactive
(pre-fetched) tokens.

## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

Unless otherwise specified, this document encodes protocol messages in TLS
notation from {{!TLS13=RFC8446}}, Section 3.

This document uses the terms "Client", "Origin", "Issuer", "Issuance Protocol",
and "Token" as defined in {{ARCHITECTURE}}. It additionally
uses the following terms in more specific ways:

- Issuer key: Keying material that can be used with an issuance protocol
to create a signed token.

- Token challenge: A request for tokens sent from an origin to a client, using
the "WWW-Authenticate" HTTP header field. This challenge identifies a specific
token issuer and issuance protocol. Token challenges optionally include
one or both of: a redemption context (see {{context-construction}}), and
a list of associated origins. These optional values are then
be bound to the token that is issued.

- Token redemption: An action by which a client presents a token to an origin
in an HTTP request, using the "Authorization" HTTP header field.

# HTTP Authentication Scheme {#challenge-redemption}

Token redemption is performed using HTTP Authentication
({{!RFC9110, Section 11}}), with the scheme "PrivateToken". Origins challenge
clients to present a token from a specific issuer ({{challenge}}). Once a
client has received a token from that issuer, or already has a valid token
available, it presents the token to the origin ({{redemption}}).

Unlike many authentication schemes in which a client will present the same
credentials across multiple requests, tokens used with the "PrivateToken"
scheme are single-use credentials, and are not reused. Spending the same token
value more than once allows the origin to link multiple transactions to the
same client. In deployment scenarios where origins send token challenges to
request tokens, origins ought to expect at most one request containing a token
from the client in reaction to a particular challenge.

The rest of this section describes the token challenge and redemption interactions
in more detail.

## Token Challenge {#challenge}

Origins send a token challenge to clients in an "WWW-Authenticate" header field
with the "PrivateToken" scheme. This challenge includes a TokenChallenge
message, along with information about what keys to use when requesting a token
from the issuer.

Origins that support this authentication scheme need to handle the following
tasks:

1. Select which issuer to use, and configure the issuer name and token-key to
include in WWW-Authenticate challenges.

1. Determine a redemption context construction to include in the
TokenChallenge, as discussed in {{context-construction}}.

1. Select the origin information to include in the TokenChallenge. This can
be empty to allow fully cross-origin tokens, a single origin name that
matches the origin itself, or a list of origin names containing the origin
itself.

All token challenges MUST begin with a 2-octet integer that defines the
token type, in network byte order. This type indicates the issuance protocol
used to generate the token and determines the structure and semantics of the rest of
the structure. Values are registered in an IANA registry, {{token-types}}. Client MUST
ignore challenges with token types they do not support.

This document defines the default challenge structure that can be used across
token types, although future token types MAY extend or modify the structure
of the challenge; see {{token-types}} for the registry information
which establishes and defines the relationship between "token_type" and the
contents of the TokenChallenge message.

Even when a given token type uses the default challenge, structure,
the requirements on the presence or interpretation of the fields can differ
across token types. For example, some token types might require that "origin_info"
is non-empty, while others allow it to be empty.

The default TokenChallenge message has the following structure:

~~~
struct {
    uint16_t token_type;
    opaque issuer_name<1..2^16-1>;
    opaque redemption_context<0..32>;
    opaque origin_info<0..2^16-1>;
} TokenChallenge;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, in network byte order, as described
above.

- "issuer_name" is an ASCII string that identifies the issuer using the format of the authority portion of a URI
as defined in {{Section 3.2 of !URI=RFC3986}}. This name identifies the issuer that is allowed to
issue tokens that can be redeemed by this origin. The field that stores this string in the challenge
is prefixed with a 2-octet integer indicating the length, in network byte order.

- "redemption_context" is a field that is either 0 or 32 bytes, prefixed with a single
octet indicating the length (either 0 or 32). If value is non-empty, it is a 32-byte value
generated by the origin that allows the origin to require that clients fetch tokens
bound to a specific context, as opposed to reusing tokens that were fetched for other
contexts. See {{context-construction}} for example contexts that might be useful in
practice. Challenges with redemption_context values of invalid lengths MUST be ignored.

- "origin_info" is an ASCII string that is either empty, or contains one or more
origin names that allow a token to be scoped to a specific set of origins. Each
origin name uses the format of the authority portion of a URI as defined in
{{Section 3.2 of URI}}. The string is prefixed with a 2-octet integer indicating
the length, in network byte order. If empty, any non-origin-specific token can be
redeemed. If the string contains multiple origin names, they are delimited with
commas "," without any whitespace. If this field is not empty, the Origin MUST
include its own name as one of the names in the list.

When used in an authentication challenge, the "PrivateToken" scheme uses the
following parameters:

- "challenge", which contains a base64url-encoded {{!RFC4648}} TokenChallenge
value. This document follows the default padding behavior described in
{{Section 3.2 of !RFC4648}}, so the base64url value MUST include padding.
As an Authentication Parameter (`auth-param` from {{!RFC9110, Section 11.2}}),
the value can be either a token or a quoted-string, and might be required to
be a quoted-string if the base64url string includes "=" characters. This
parameter is required for all challenges.

- "token-key", which contains a base64url encoding of the public key for
use with the issuance protocol indicated by the challenge. See {{ISSUANCE}}
for more information about how this public key is used by the issuance protocols
in that specification. The encoding of
the public key is determined by the token type; see {{token-types}}.
As with "challenge", the base64url value MUST include padding. As an
Authentication Parameter (`auth-param` from {{!RFC9110, Section 11.2}}), the
value can be either a token or a quoted-string, and might be required to be a
quoted-string if the base64url string includes "=" characters. This parameter
MAY be omitted in deployments where clients are able to retrieve the issuer key
using an out-of-band mechanism.

- "max-age", an optional parameter that consists of the number of seconds for
which the challenge will be accepted by the origin.

The header field MAY also include the standard "realm" parameter, if desired.
Issuance protocols MAY require other parameters. Clients SHOULD ignore unknown
parameters in challenges, except if otherwise specified by issuance protocols.

As an example, the WWW-Authenticate header field could look like this:

~~~
WWW-Authenticate:
  PrivateToken challenge="abc...", token-key="123..."
~~~

Upon receipt of this challenge, a client validates the TokenChallenge before
responding to it. Validation requirements are as follows:

- The token_type is recognized and supported by the client;
- The TokenChallenge structure is well-formed; and
- If the origin_info field is non-empty, the name of the origin that issued the
  authentication challenge is included in the list of origin names. Comparison
  of the origin name that issued the authentication challenge against elements
  in the origin_info list is done via case-insensitive equality checks.

If validation fails, the client MUST NOT process or respond to the
challenge. Clients MAY have further restrictions and requirements around
validating when a challenge is considered acceptable or valid. For example,
clients can choose to ignore challenges that list origin names for which the
current connection is not authoritative (according to the TLS certificate).

Caching and pre-fetching of tokens is discussed in {{caching}}.

Note that it is possible for the WWW-Authenticate header field to include
multiple challenges ({{!RFC9110, Section 11.6.1}}). This allows the origin to indicate support for different
token types, issuers, or to include multiple redemption contexts. For example,
the WWW-Authenticate header field could look like this:

~~~
WWW-Authenticate:
  PrivateToken challenge="abc...", token-key="123...",
  PrivateToken challenge="def...", token-key="234..."
~~~

Origins should only include challenges for different types of issuance
protocols with functionally equivalent properties. For instance, both issuance
protocols in {{ISSUANCE}} have the same functional properties, albeit with
different mechanisms for verifying the resulting tokens during redemption.
Since clients are free to choose which challenge they want to consume when
presented with options, mixing multiple challenges with different functional
properties for one use case is nonsensical. If the origin has a preference
for one challenge over another (for example, if one uses a token type
that is faster to verify), it can sort it to be first in the list
of challenges as a hint to the client.

### Redemption Context Construction {#context-construction}

The TokenChallenge redemption context allows the origin to determine the
context in which a given token can be redeemed. This value can be a unique
per-request nonce, constructed from 32 freshly generated random bytes. It
can also represent state or properties of the client session. Some example
properties and methods for constructing the corresponding context are below.
This list is not exhaustive.

- Context bound to a given time window: Construct redemption context as
  F(current time window), where F is a pseudorandom function.
- Context bound to a client network: Construct redemption context as
  F(client ASN), where F is a pseudorandom function.
- Context bound to a given time window and client network: Construct redemption
  context as F(current time window, client ASN), where F is a pseudorandom function.

An empty redemption context is not bound to any property of the client session.
Preventing double spending on tokens requires the origin to keep state
associated with the redemption context. The size of this state varies based on
the size of the redemption context. For example, double spend state for unique,
per-request redemption contexts only needs to exist within the scope of
the request connection or session. In contrast, double spend state for empty
redemption contexts must be stored and shared across all requests until
token-key expiration or rotation.

Origins that share redemption contexts, i.e., by using the same redemption
context, choosing the same issuer, and providing the same origin_info field in
the TokenChallenge, must necessarily share state required to enforce double
spend prevention. Origins should consider the operational complexity of this
shared state before choosing to share redemption contexts. Failure to
successfully synchronize this state and use it for double spend prevention can
allow Clients to redeem tokens to one Origin that were issued after an
interaction with another Origin that shares the context.

### Token Caching {#caching}

Clients can generate multiple tokens from a single TokenChallenge, and cache
them for future use. This improves privacy by separating the time of token
issuance from the time of token redemption, and also allows clients to avoid
any overhead of receiving new tokens via the issuance protocol.

Cached tokens can only be redeemed when they match all of the fields in the
TokenChallenge: token_type, issuer_name, redemption_context, and origin_info.
Clients ought to store cached tokens based on all of these fields, to
avoid trying to redeem a token that does not match. Note that each token
has a unique client nonce, which is sent in token redemption ({{redemption}}).

If a client fetches a batch of multiple tokens for future use that are bound
to a specific redemption context (the redemption_context in the TokenChallenge
was not empty), clients SHOULD discard these tokens upon flushing state such as
HTTP cookies {{?COOKIES=I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis}}, or if there is a network
change and the client does not have any origin-specific state like HTTP cookies.
Using these tokens in a context that otherwise would not be linkable to the
original context could allow the origin to recognize a client.

## Token Redemption {#redemption}

The output of the issuance protocol is a token that corresponds to the origin's
challenge (see {{challenge}}). A token is a structure that begins with a
two-octet field that indicates a token type, which MUST match the token_type in
the TokenChallenge structure. This value determines the structure and semantics
of the rest of token structure.

This document defines the default token structure that can be used across
token types, although future token types MAY extend or modify the structure
of the token; see {{token-types}} for the registry information which
establishes and defines the relationship between "token_type" and the contents
of the Token structure.

The default Token message has the following structure:

~~~
struct {
    uint16_t token_type;
    uint8_t nonce[32];
    uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
    uint8_t token_key_id[Nid];
    uint8_t authenticator[Nk];
} Token;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, in network byte order, as described
above.

- "nonce" is a 32-octet value containing a client-generated random nonce.

- "challenge_digest" is a 32-octet value containing the hash of the
original TokenChallenge, SHA-256(TokenChallenge), where SHA-256 is as defined
in {{!SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}}. Changing the hash function to something
other than SHA-256 would require defining a new token type and token structure
(since the contents of challenge_digest would be computed differently),
which can be done in a future specification.

- "token_key_id" is a Nid-octet identifier for the token authentication
key. The value of this field is defined by the token_type and corresponding
issuance protocol.

- "authenticator" is a Nk-octet authenticator that is cryptographically bound
to the preceding fields in the token; see {{verification}} for more information
about how this field is used in verifying a token. The token_type and corresponding
issuance protocol determine the value of the authenticator field and how it is computed.
The value of constant Nk depends on token_type, as defined in {{token-types}}.

The authenticator value in the Token structure is computed over the token_type,
nonce, challenge_digest, and token_key_id fields. A token is considered a valid
if token verification using succeeds; see {{verification}} for details about
verifying the token and its authenticator value.

When used for client authorization, the "PrivateToken" authentication
scheme defines one parameter, "token", which contains the base64url-encoded
Token struct. As with the challenge parameters ({{challenge}}), the base64url
value MUST include padding. As an Authentication Parameter (`auth-param` from
{{!RFC9110, Section 11.2}}), the value can be either a token or a
quoted-string, and might be required to be a quoted-string if the base64url
string includes "=" characters. All unknown or unsupported parameters to
"PrivateToken" authentication credentials MUST be ignored.

Clients present this Token structure to origins in a new HTTP request using
the Authorization header field as follows:

~~~
Authorization: PrivateToken token="abc..."
~~~

For context-bound tokens, origins store or reconstruct the contexts of previous
TokenChallenge structures in order to validate the token. A TokenChallenge can
be bound to a specific TLS session with a client, but origins can also accept
tokens for valid challenges in new sessions. Origins SHOULD implement some form
of double-spend prevention that prevents a token with the same nonce from being
redeemed twice. Double-spend prevention ensures that clients cannot replay tokens
for previous challenges. For context-bound tokens, this double-spend prevention
can require no state or minimal state, since the context can be used to verify
token uniqueness.

If a client is unable to fetch a token, it MUST react to the challenge as
if it could not produce a valid Authorization response.

### Token Verification {#verification}

A token consists of some input cryptographically bound to an authenticator
value, such as a digital signature. Verifying a token consists of checking that
the authenticator value is correct.

The authenticator value is as computed when running and finalizing the issuance
protocol corresponding to the token type with the following value as the input:

~~~
struct {
    uint16_t token_type;
    uint8_t nonce[32];
    uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
    uint8_t token_key_id[Nid];
} AuthenticatorInput;
~~~

The value of these fields are as described in {{redemption}}. The cryptographic
verification check depends on the token type; see {{Section 5.4 of ISSUANCE}}
and {{Section 6.4 of ISSUANCE}} for verification instructions for the issuance
protocols described in {{ISSUANCE}}. As such, the security properties of the
token, e.g., the probability that one can forge an authenticator value without
invoking the issuance protocol, depend on the cryptographic algorithm used by
the issuance protocol as determined by the token type.

# User Interaction {#interaction}

When used in contexts like websites, origins that challenge clients for
tokens need to consider how to optimize their interaction model to ensure a
good user experience.

Origins SHOULD minimize the number of challenges sent on a particular client
session, such as a unique TLS session between a client and origin
(referred to as the "redemption context" in {{ARCHITECTURE}}). Similarly, clients
SHOULD have some implementation-specific policy to minimize the number of tokens
that can be retrieved by origins. One possible implementation of this policy is
to bound the number of token challenges a given origin can provide for a given
session.

Token challenges can be performed without explicit user involvement, depending
on the issuance protocol. If tokens are scoped to a specific origin,
there is no need for per-challenge user interaction. Note that the issuance
protocol may separately involve user interaction if the client needs to be
newly validated.

If a client cannot use cached tokens to respond to a challenge, either because
it has run out of cached tokens or the associated context is unique, the token
issuance process can add user-perceivable latency. Origins need not block
useful work such as loading the contents of a web page on token authentication.
Instead, token authentication can be used in similar ways to existing CAPTCHA
validation flows, wherein validation sometimes proceeds alongside useful work,
e.g., when loading contents of a web page, but without the need for user interaction.
If issuance is taking a long time, an origin can fall back to another method
of user validation.

An origin MUST NOT use more than one redemption context value for a given token
type and issuer per client request. If an origin issues a large number of
challenges with unique contexts, such as more than once for each request, this
can indicate that the origin is either not functioning correctly or is trying
to attack or overload the client or issuance server. In such cases, a client
MUST ignore redundant token challenges for the same request and SHOULD alert
the user if possible.

Origins MAY include multiple challenges, where each challenge refers to a
different issuer or a different token type, to allow clients to choose a
preferred issuer or type.

An origin MUST NOT assume that token challenges will always yield a valid
token. Clients might experience issues running the issuance protocol, e.g.,
because the attester or issuer is unavailable, or clients might simply not
support the requested token type. Origins SHOULD account for such operational
or interoperability failures by offering clients a fallback challenge such
as CAPTCHA for accessing a resource. Failure to provide a fallback will likely
mean that some clients fail authentication and cannot perform the desired
action, such as loading a web page or accessing some other resource.

For example, consider a scenario in which the client is a web browser, and the
origin can accept either a token or a solution to a puzzle intended to
determine if the client is a real human user. The origin would send clients a
401 HTTP response that contains a token challenge in a "WWW-Authenticate"
header field along with content that contains the puzzle to display to the
user. Clients that are able to respond with a token will be able to
automatically return the token and not show the puzzle, while clients that
either do not support tokens or are unable to fetch tokens at a particular
time can present the user with the puzzle.

To mitigate the risk of deployments becoming dependent on tokens, clients and
origins SHOULD grease their behavior unless explicitly configured not to. In
particular, clients SHOULD ignore token challenges with some non-zero
probability. From the origin's perspective, ignoring a token challenge is
indistinguishable from the issuance protocol failing for arbitrary reasons
(excluding what can be inferred from latency between the client and origin interaction).
Likewise, origins SHOULD randomly choose to not challenge clients for tokens
with some non-zero probability. Moreover, origins SHOULD include random token
types, from the Reserved list of "greased" types (defined in {{token-types}}),
with some non-zero probability.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

The security properties of token challenges vary depending on whether the
challenge contains a redemption context or not, as well as whether the
challenge is per-origin or not. For example, cross-origin tokens with empty
contexts can be replayed from one party by another, as shown below.

~~~ aasvg
+--------+           +----------+               +--------+
| Origin |           | Attacker |               | Client |
+---+----+           +----+-----+               +---+----+
    |                     |                         |
    +-- TokenChallenge -->|                         |
    |                     +-- (replay challenge) -->|
    |                     |<-------- Token ---------+
    |<-- (replay token) --+                         |
    |                     |
~~~
{: #fig-replay title="Replay attack example"}

Moreover, when a Client holds cross-origin tokens with empty contexts, it
is possible for any Origin in the cross-origin set to deplete that Client
set of tokens. To prevent this from happening, tokens can be scoped to single
Origins (with non-empty origin_info) such that they can only be redeemed for
a single Origin. Alternatively, if tokens are cross-Origin, Clients can use
alternate methods to prevent many tokens from being redeemed at once. For
example, if the Origin requests an excess of tokens, the Client could choose to
not present any tokens for verification if a redemption had already
occurred in a given time window.

Token challenges that include non-empty origin_info bind tokens to one or more
specific origins. As described in {{challenge}}, clients only accept such
challenges from origin names listed in the origin_info string. Even if multiple
origins are listed, a token can only be redeemed for an origin if the challenge
has a match for the origin_info. For example, if "a.example.com" issues
a challenge with an origin_info string of "a.example.com,b.example.com", a
client could redeem a token fetched for this challenge if and only if
"b.example.com" also included an origin_info string of
"a.example.com,b.example.com". On the other hand, if "b.example.com" had an
origin_info string of "b.example.com" or "b.example.com,a.example.com" or
"a.example.com,b.example.com,c.example.com", the string would not match and the
client would need to use a different token.

Context-bound token challenges require clients to obtain matching tokens when
challenged, rather than presenting a token that was obtained from a different
context in the past. This can make it more likely that issuance and redemption
events will occur at approximately the same time. For example, if a client is
challenged for a token with a unique context at time T1 and then subsequently
obtains a token at time T2, a colluding issuer and origin can link this to the
same client if T2 is unique to the client. This linkability is less feasible as
the number of issuance events at time T2 increases. Depending on the "max-age"
token challenge parameter, clients MAY try to add delay to the time between
being challenged and redeeming a token to make this sort of linkability more
difficult. For more discussion on correlation risks between token issuance and
redemption, see {{ARCHITECTURE}}.

As discussed in {{challenge}}, clients SHOULD discard any context-bound tokens
upon flushing cookies or changing networks, to prevent an origin using the
redemption context state as a cookie to recognize clients.

Applications SHOULD constrain tokens to a single origin unless the use case can
accommodate such replay attacks. Replays are also possible if the client
redeems a token sent as part of 0-RTT data. If successful token redemption
produces side effects, origins SHOULD implement an anti-replay mechanism to
mitigate the harm of such replays. See {{TLS13, Section 8}} and
{{?RFC9001, Section 9.2}} for details about anti-replay mechanisms, as well as
{{?RFC8470, Section 3}} for discussion about safety considerations for 0-RTT
HTTP data.

All random values in the challenge and token MUST be generated using a
cryptographically secure source of randomness ({{?RFC4086}}).

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

## Authentication Scheme

This document registers the "PrivateToken" authentication scheme in the
"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme Registry" defined
in {{!RFC9110, Section 16.4}}.

Authentication Scheme Name:
: PrivateToken

Pointer to specification text:
: {{challenge-redemption}} of this document

## Token Type Registry {#token-types}

IANA is requested to create a new "Privacy Pass Token Type" registry in a new
"Privacy Pass Parameters" page to list identifiers for issuance protocols
defined for use with the Privacy Pass token authentication scheme. These
identifiers are two-byte values, so the maximum possible value is
0xFFFF = 65535.

New registrations need to list the following attributes:

Value:
: The two-byte identifier for the algorithm

Name:
: Name of the issuance protocol

Token Structure:
: The contents of the Token structure in {{redemption}}

Token Key Encoding:
: The encoding of the "token-key" parameter in {{redemption}}

TokenChallenge Structure:
: The contents of the TokenChallenge structure in {{challenge}}

Publicly Verifiable:
: A Y/N value indicating if the output tokens are
  publicly verifiable

Public Metadata:
: A Y/N value indicating if the output tokens can contain
  public metadata.

Private Metadata:
: A Y/N value indicating if the output tokens can contain
  private metadata.

Nk:
: The length in bytes of an output authenticator

Nid:
: The length of the token key identifier

Reference:
: Where this algorithm is defined

Notes:
: Any notes associated with the entry
{: spacing="compact"}


New entries in this registry are subject to the Specification Required
registration policy ({{!RFC8126, Section 4.6}}). Designated experts need to
ensure that the token type is sufficiently clearly defined to be used for both
token issuance and redemption, and meets the common security and privacy
requirements for issuance protocols defined in {{Section 3.2 of ARCHITECTURE}}.

{{ISSUANCE}} defines entries for this registry.


### Reserved Values

This document defines several Reserved values, which can be used by clients
and servers to send "greased" values in token challenges and responses to
ensure that implementations remain able to handle unknown token types
gracefully (this technique is inspired by {{?RFC8701}}). Implementations SHOULD
select reserved values at random when including them in greased messages.
Servers can include these in TokenChallenge structures, either as the only
challenge when no real token type is desired, or as one challenge in a list of
challenges that include real values. Clients can include these in Token
structures when they are not able to present a real token response. The
contents of the Token structure SHOULD be filled with random bytes when
using greased values.

The initial contents for this registry consists of multiple reserved values,
with the following attributes, which are repeated for each registration:

Value:
: 0x0000, 0x02AA, 0x1132, 0x2E96, 0x3CD3, 0x4473, 0x5A63, 0x6D32, 0x7F3F,
  0x8D07, 0x916B, 0xA6A4, 0xBEAB, 0xC3F3, 0xDA42, 0xE944, 0xF057

### Private Use Values

Values 0xFF00-0xFFFF are reserved for private use. Implementers can use values
in this range for experimentation with new token type protocols, as well as other
proprietary uses that do not require interoperability.

The registry is to be initialized with the following entry for Private Use:

Value:
: 0xFF00-0xFFFF

Name:
: Private Use

Token Structure:
: The contents of the Token structure in {{redemption}}

Token Key Encoding:

# Test Vectors

This section includes test vectors for the HTTP authentication scheme specified
in this document. It consists of the following types of test vectors:

1. Test vectors for the challenge and redemption protocols. Implementations can
use these test vectors for verifying code that builds and encodes
TokenChallenge structures, as well as code that produces a well-formed Token
bound to a TokenChallenge.
2. Test vectors for the HTTP headers used for authentication. Implementations
can use these test vectors for validating whether they parse HTTP
authentication headers correctly to produce TokenChallenge structures and the
other associated parameters, such as the token-key and max-age values.

## Challenge and Redemption Structure Test Vectors

This section includes test vectors for the challenge and redemption
functionalities described in {{challenge}} and {{redemption}}. Each test vector
lists the following values:

- token_type: The type of token issuance protocol, a value from
  {{token-types}}. For these test vectors, token_type is 0x0002, corresponding
  to the issuance protocol in {{?ISSUANCE=I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol}}.
- issuer_name: The name of the issuer in the TokenChallenge structure,
  represented as a hexadecimal string.
- redemption_context: The redemption context in the TokenChallenge structure,
  represented as a hexadecimal string.
- origin_info: The origin info in the TokenChallenge structure, represented as
  a hexadecimal string.
- nonce: The nonce in the Token structure, represented as a hexadecimal string.
- token_key: The public token-key, encoded based on the corresponding token
  type, represented as a hexadecimal string.
- token_authenticator_input: The values in the Token structure used to compute
  the Token authenticator value, represented as a hexadecimal string.

Test vectors are provided for each of the following TokenChallenge
configurations:

1. TokenChallenge with a single origin and non-empty redemption context
2. TokenChallenge with a single origin and empty redemption context
3. TokenChallenge with an empty origin and redemption context
4. TokenChallenge with an empty origin and non-empty redemption context
5. TokenChallenge with a multiple origins and non-empty redemption context

These test vectors are below.

## HTTP Header Test Vectors

This section includes test vectors the contents of the HTTP authentication
headers. Each test vector consists of one or more challenges that comprise
a WWW-Authenticate header. For each challenge, the token-type, token-key,
max-age, and token-challenge parameters are listed. Each challenge also
includes an unknown (not specified) parameter that implementations are meant
to ignore.

The parameters for each challenge are indexed by their position
in the WWW-Authentication challenge list. For example, token-key-0 denotes
the token-key parameter for the first challenge in the list, whereas
token-key-1 denotes the token-key for the second challenge in the list.

The resulting wire-encoded WWW-Authentication header based on this
list of challenges is then listed at the end.
