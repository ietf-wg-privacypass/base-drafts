It seems to me that it is easy for individual clients to identify and react to servers that seem to be acting maliciously. For example, the client can monitor and reject key material from servers where the configuration was last modified very recently and how often the rotations seem to be occurring. However, I'm not exactly sure what the reporting mechanism should be to alert other clients to this behavior.",

I was thinking on something like this:\r\n\r\n* When a server updates their configuration (every 1 to 12 weeks as recommended), it does not immediately use this new configuration; but rather continues using the old one for shorter time frame (less than the 1 to 12 weeks, referred now as `t`), and makes clients aware of a new configuration that is coming. During `t`, the server cannot generate a new configuration. When `t` passes, the server starts using the new configuration (which clients can be sort of aware already). \r\n\r\nThis will make hard for a server to update in quick intervals, and that new configurations are not immediately used.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about how much this will work, and I'll have to think more about it ;)\r\n\r\nSomething, that I don't know if is mentioned in the drafts is defining what happens is a server is rendered unavailable, in some sort of DoS.

Currently, the protocol assumes a protocol that runs in one round trip, with some offline public key distribution step. In particular, issuance request messages are mapped almost directly to the underlying OPRF blind/request message. \r\n\r\nWe should consider what needs to change, if anything, to accommodate these differently shaped protocols. I suggest we loosen the 1-1 restriction (?) from the Privacy Pass API to the underlying cryptographic protocol APIs. It just so happens that Privacy Pass maps nicely to the OPRF construction, but that need not be the case. For example, and hand waving over details, in the blind Schnorr case, an implementation of the issuance request flow could involve first fetching the nonce commitment from the server, and then sending a blinded value for evaluation. \r\n\r\n@dvorak42, what do you think?",

      "body": "Currently, RedemptionRequest messages have the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct {\r\n  opaque data<1..2^16-1>; // input to the token issuance flow\r\n  opaque tag<1..2^16-1>;  // output of the token issuance flow\r\n  opaque info<1..2^16-1>; // application information bound to the token\r\n} RedemptionRequest;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has a couple of interesting properties. First, anyone with access to `data` can replay it in the issuance flow and compute `tag`. We might be able to address that by making the redemption flow a two round protocol, similar to what we've done for the issuance flow, or by allowing clients to encrypt `data` under the redeemer's public key. Or something else entirely.\r\n\r\nSecond, `tag` effectively authenticates `info`. Is there any reason why we couldn't merge these two fields and encrypt the latter with an AEAD? And if we were to do that, perhaps we could simplify the redemption interface and have it produce a secret that applications use as needed? Specifically, the `Redeem` function might return a secret rather than a `RedemptionRequest`. Turning the redemption API into an Export-like interface might help accommodate different application use cases.\r\n\r\ncc @armfazh, @siyengar, @dvorak42",
